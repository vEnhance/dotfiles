" Pet peeves
inoremap <C-R><C-R> As a reminder (see syllabus 3.2, third bullet), it's appreciated if you can include the sources of problems (e.g. "Shortlist 2018 A7") when provided. The problem numbers can often change during edits.
inoremap <C-R><C-D> Small LaTeX tip: you should generally use \dots over \cdots or "...". (In a list, you want the dots to be bottom-aligned. But \dots will automatically detect the alignment for you.)
inoremap <C-R><C-O> LaTeX tip: When typing any of the operators \min, \max, \deg, \gcd, \log, \exp, \sin, \cos, \tan you should always remember to include the backslash. This ensures the operator is properly typed in Roman font, rather than interpreted as a string of badly named variables.
inoremap <C-R><C-T> LaTeX tip: use `\mid` instead of `\|` to denote divisibility.
inoremap <C-R><C-M> Small LaTeX tip: use `\pmod{n}` to typeset (mod n).
inoremap <C-R><C-S> Small LaTeX tip: use `\cdot` to typeset multiplication rather than `*`.
inoremap <C-R><C-Q> In LaTeX, quotes are a bit weird; see https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/10672/76888.

inoremap <C-R><C-F> Congratulations on submitting your first unit! Welcome aboard. ðŸ™‚
