(Comic is [xkcd #974](https://xkcd.com/974/).)

These are the dotfiles for [Evan Chen](https://web.evanchen.cc).
It's obviously mostly meant for personal use in keeping my dotfiles
synced across all my operating systems.
But I figured it might be helpful to others who are looking for ideas
of what kind of configuration options are out there,
ideas for software to try out, and so on.

If you are really daring, you can try to run `INSTALL.sh` which will create
a lot of symlinks in your home directory ðŸ˜‰
but you should probably read it first before you attempt this.

I (Evan) have the following allegiances:

- [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org) as Linux distribution
- [i3](https://i3wm.org/) as window manager
- [NeoVim](https://www.neovim.io) as a text editor
  - [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as a package manager
- [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) as TeX distribution
- [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as a shell
  - [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) as a Fish package manager

Keybindings are optimized for [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard).
