C-TWENTY

According to the American Optometric Association:
every 20 minutes you spend looking at a digital device or computer screen, you
should look at something else that is 20 feet away for a period of 20 seconds.

This is a Python script I wrote to enforce this. When run in the background,
using this dotfile system, it will cause i3 to enter an unusable state "trap"
while a short melody plays in the background for around 20 seconds.

It can be disabled temporarily by sending the SIGTSTP signal to it.
It will also automatically disable itself if it sees i3lock running.
It will resume when sent a SIGCONT signal.

Also, sending a SIGUSR1 will cause the script to fire immediately.
This is useful so that I can essentially *choose* my breaks
so long as there is one at least every twenty minutes.
Otherwise, I find myself constantly interrupted mid-sentence,
which is pretty annoying. :P
